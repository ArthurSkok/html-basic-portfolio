<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Electrical Engineer from NYC that dabbles in a little bit of everything. Backend code, frontend design, database schema, cloud infrastructure, I aspire to be a well-rounded developer that might not necessarily be an expert in everything but can learn just about anything.</p>


<p>Currently still in NYC, working on a better portfolio while working part-time remotely for companies whose visions and goals I believe in and am passionate around.</p>
